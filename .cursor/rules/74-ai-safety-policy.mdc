# AI safety policy (L9)

## Content safety constraints

- Prompts and kernels must not encourage or enable:
  - Abuse, harassment, or targeted harm.
  - Illegal activities or serious safety risks.
  - Disclosure of sensitive secrets or credentials.

---

## PII and sensitive data

- Avoid including real PII or sensitive data in prompt examples or configs.
- Where PII-like data is required for testing or examples, use anonymized or clearly synthetic values.

---

## Logging and redaction

- Logs that may contain user content should:
  - Avoid storing raw secrets or highly sensitive PII.
  - Redact or anonymize such fields where feasible.
- Treat safety and privacy requirements as **non-optional** constraints on how prompts and kernels are designed and used.
