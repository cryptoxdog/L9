## 🎯 THE SYSTEM EXPLAINED

### Core Concept
**Every code fix follows 6 mandatory phases, in order, with zero exceptions.**

### The 6 Phases
```
Phase -1: PLAN       (5 min)  ← Locked plan before any coding
Phase  0: VERIFY     (2 min)  ← Confirm all assumptions
Phase  1: CODE       (15 min) ← Implement changes (match plan exactly)
Phase  2: GUARD      (5 min)  ← Add enforcement/guards
Phase  3: SAFETY     (5 min)  ← Add fail-fast checks
Phase  4: TEST       (10 min) ← Comprehensive validation
Phase  5: AUDIT      (5 min)  ← Final review and sign-off
```

### Total Time
- Simple fix: 30 min
- Medium fix: 47 min
- Complex fix: 90 min

### Guarantee
**If you complete all 6 phases and get 100% on all checklists, your fix is production-ready.**

## 📋 FILE SELECTION FLOWCHART

```
Working on L9 VPS?
├─ YES → Use g-cmp-l9-special.md
└─ NO → Use g-cmp-v2-revised.md

First time with G-CMP?
├─ YES → Read g-cmp-implementation.md (10 min)
└─ NO → Skip setup guide

Know the 6 phases already?
├─ YES → Keep g-cmp-quickref.md visible (reference only)
└─ NO → Open g-cmp-v2-revised.md (detailed instructions)

Need to track progress?
├─ YES → Use g-cmp-checklist.md (print or digital)
└─ NO → Optional

Need quick overview?
├─ YES → Read g-cmp-final-summary.md (this file)
└─ NO → Skip to implementation
```

---

## 🔑 CRITICAL RULES (MANDATORY)

**These apply to EVERY task, EVERY time:**

```
1. PLAN BEFORE CODING
   └─ Phase -1 creates locked plan
   └─ Zero code before plan exists

2. VERIFY BEFORE IMPLEMENTING
   └─ Phase 0 confirms all assumptions
   └─ STOP if any assumption fails

3. MATCH PLAN EXACTLY
   └─ Phase 1 implements plan, nothing more
   └─ No refactoring, no "improvements"

4. FAIL FAST
   └─ First error stops execution
   └─ No workarounds, no skipping

5. ALL PHASES MANDATORY
   └─ 6 phases, in order, every time
   └─ Cannot skip, combine, or reorder

6. EXPLICIT FINAL REPORT
   └─ Must output professional report
   └─ Must declare "COMPLETE ✓"
```

---

## ✅ DEFINITION OF DONE (ALL 10 MUST BE TRUE)

Before you declare "COMPLETE", check:

- [ ] Phase -1 plan created and LOCKED
- [ ] Phase 0 baseline confirmed (ALL assumptions ✓)
- [ ] Phase 1 implementation COMPLETE (matches plan)
- [ ] Phase 2 enforcement ADDED (guards in place)
- [ ] Phase 3 system guards ADDED (fail-fast works)
- [ ] Phase 4 validation COMPLETE (all tests ✓)
- [ ] Phase 5 final audit COMPLETE (no gaps)
- [ ] All checklists PASSED (100%)
- [ ] No further changes NEEDED
- [ ] System READY for deployment

**If ALL 10 are ✓ → Output FINAL REPORT and declare COMPLETE**

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I HAVE to use all 5 files?**
A: No. Minimum: g-cmp-v2-revised.md + g-cmp-quickref.md. Others are supporting/reference.

**Q: Is this overkill for simple fixes?**
A: No. Even simple fixes benefit from planning + testing + final audit. Takes 30 min total.

**Q: Can I skip Phase 0?**
A: No. Phase 0 catches assumptions you don't know are wrong. Always run it.

**Q: What if I'm stuck?**
A: Refer to "When Stuck" section in quickref or checklist. Most common answers there.

**Q: How do I know I'm done?**
A: Check Definition of Done. All 10 items ✓? You're done. If not, go back to failed phase.

**Q: Can I use this for non-code fixes?**
A: Yes. System works for any fix: code, config, infrastructure, documentation.

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|---------|----------|
| Skip Phase -1 planning | Always plan first (5 min) |
| Code without plan | Create locked plan before typing |
| Ignore failed assumptions | STOP if Phase 0 fails, re-plan |
| Refactor beyond plan | Surgical changes only |
| Keep coding after error | STOP immediately, fix, re-run phase |
| Skip Phase 4 testing | All tests are mandatory |
| Combine phases | Each phase must complete fully |
| Silent changes | Document everything |

---
