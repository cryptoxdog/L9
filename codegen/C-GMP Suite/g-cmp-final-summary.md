## THE SYSTEM AT A GLANCE

```
GOAL: Fix code deterministically, without errors or rework

INPUT: Problem description, affected files

PROCESS:
Phase -1 → Create locked plan (5 min)
Phase  0 → Verify assumptions (2 min)
Phase  1 → Implement changes (15 min)
Phase  2 → Add guards (5 min)
Phase  3 → Add safety checks (5 min)
Phase  4 → Run tests (10 min)
Phase  5 → Final audit (5 min)

OUTPUT: Final report + deployed fix

TOTAL TIME: ~45 minutes

GUARANTEE: If you follow all 6 phases + get all ✓, fix is production-ready
```

## HOW TO USE (3 SCENARIOS)

### SCENARIO 1: First Time (New to G-CMP)

**Time: ~50 minutes**

1. **Read quickref** (3 min) → Understand phases
2. **Open full template** in Cursor (split pane)
3. **Choose context profile** (1, 2, 3, or 4)
4. **Fill in [BRACKETS]** with your problem
5. **Execute Phase -1 through Phase 5** (follow exactly)
6. **Output final report**
7. **Done ✓**

### SCENARIO 2: L9 VPS Fix (Using Specialization)

**Time: ~45 minutes**

1. **Open g-cmp-l9-special.md** instead of base template
2. **Choose L9 profile** (1A, 1B, 3A, etc.)
3. **Fill in [BRACKETS]** with your L9 problem
4. **Use L9 file paths** (/opt/l9/api/server.py, etc.)
5. **Use L9 commands** (docker compose, curl health, etc.)
6. **Execute all phases** with L9 context
7. **Output L9-customized final report**
8. **Done ✓**

### SCENARIO 3: Quick Fix (Experienced User)

**Time: ~35 minutes**

1. **Keep quickref.md open** in one tab
2. **Open full template** in another tab (reference only)
3. **Plan Phase -1** (2 min, minimal writing)
4. **Execute Phases 1-5** fast (30 min)
5. **Quick final report**
6. **Done ✓**

## THE 6 PHASES (ALWAYS IN ORDER)

| Phase | Time | What You Do | Output | STOP IF |
|-------|------|------------|--------|---------|
| -1 | 5m | Plan fixes | Locked plan | Plan is unclear |
| 0 | 2m | Verify assumptions | Baseline ✓ | Assumption fails |
| 1 | 15m | Implement changes | Code done | Doesn't match plan |
| 2 | 5m | Add guards | Guards in place | Guard is weak |
| 3 | 5m | Add safety | Fail-fast ready | Guard missing |
| 4 | 10m | Test everything | Tests pass | Test fails |
| 5 | 5m | Final audit | System ready | Gaps found |

---

## CRITICAL RULES (MANDATORY)

```
1. PLAN BEFORE CODING (Phase -1)
   └─ No code without plan
   └─ Plan is immutable once locked

2. VERIFY ASSUMPTIONS (Phase 0)
   └─ Must pass all checks
   └─ STOP if any fails

3. MATCH PLAN EXACTLY (Phase 1)
   └─ Surgical changes only
   └─ No refactoring beyond plan

4. FAIL FAST (All Phases)
   └─ First error stops execution
   └─ No workarounds, no skipping

5. ALL PHASES MANDATORY
   └─ Every phase has checklist
   └─ Cannot skip or combine

6. RE-RUN ENTIRE PHASE IF IT FAILS
   └─ Not just the failed item
   └─ Entire phase from start
```

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE (ALL 10 MUST BE TRUE)

Before you declare "COMPLETE", verify:

✓ Phase -1 plan created and LOCKED
✓ Phase 0 baseline confirmed (ALL assumptions ✓)
✓ Phase 1 implementation COMPLETE (matches plan exactly)
✓ Phase 2 enforcement ADDED (guards in place)
✓ Phase 3 system guards ADDED (fail-fast checks work)
✓ Phase 4 second pass validation COMPLETE (all tests ✓)
✓ Phase 5 final sanity sweep COMPLETE (no gaps)
✓ All checklists PASSED (100%)
✓ No further changes JUSTIFIED
✓ System is READY for deployment

**If all 10 are ✓ → Output FINAL REPORT and declare COMPLETE**

## FILE LOCATIONS & SETUP

### Save These Files

```
~/.cursor/g-cmp-v2-revised.md       (Main template)
~/.cursor/g-cmp-l9-special.md       (L9 variant)
~/.cursor/g-cmp-quickref.md         (Quick ref)
~/.cursor/g-cmp-implementation.md   (Setup guide)
~/.cursor/g-cmp-checklist.md        (Print checklist)
```

### Cursor Tab Setup (Recommended)

```
Tab 1: g-cmp-quickref.md       ← ALWAYS OPEN (reference)
Tab 2: g-cmp-v2-revised.md     ← Work here (fill in phases)
Tab 3: server.py (or target)   ← File being edited
```

**Or split pane:**
```
Left:  g-cmp-quickref.md       (reference)
Right: g-cmp-v2-revised.md     (work here)
Bottom: File being edited
```

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I HAVE to follow all 6 phases?**
A: YES. Non-negotiable. If you skip any, you risk mistakes.

**Q: What if my fix is "simple"?**
A: Doesn't matter. All fixes go through 6 phases. Simple fixes move fast (30 min), complex fixes move slow (60 min). Both follow same process.

**Q: Can I skip Phase 0 if I'm confident?**
A: NO. Phase 0 catches assumptions you didn't know were wrong. Always run it.

**Q: What if Phase 4 test fails?**
A: STOP. Fix the issue. Re-run ENTIRE Phase 4 (not just the failing test).

**Q: Can I combine phases?**
A: NO. Each phase must complete fully before moving to next.

**Q: When do I output the final report?**
A: After Phase 5 is complete AND all 10 items in Definition of Done are ✓.

**Q: Can I add extra features not in the plan?**
A: NO. Document them as follow-up tasks. Complete current task first.

**Q: How long does this take?**
A: 45 minutes average (30 min simple, 60 min complex). Planning is 5 min, coding is 15 min, testing/audit is 25 min.

**Q: Is this really faster than "just coding"?**
A: YES. You avoid rework, mistakes, and debugging. Invest 5 min in Phase -1, save 30 min in rework.

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK GUIDE

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I don't know what to change" | Re-read Phase -1 plan. If still unclear, re-run Phase -1. |
| "Phase 0 assumption failed" | STOP. Document failure. Re-run Phase -1 completely. |
| "My code doesn't match the plan" | STOP. Revert changes. Re-run Phase 1. Follow plan exactly. |
| "Test failing in Phase 4" | STOP. Fix issue. Re-run ENTIRE Phase 4. Don't skip to Phase 5. |
| "Phase 5 found gaps" | STOP. Fix gaps. Re-run Phase 5. Then declare DONE. |
| "Want to add something extra" | Document as follow-up. Keep current task in scope. |
| "Not sure if I'm done" | Check Definition of Done. All 10 items ✓? If yes → done. If no → go back to failed phase. |
