L9 Collaborative Cells - Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework
============================================================

Cognitive cells that coordinate multiple agents for:
- Architecture design (ArchitectCell)
- Code implementation (CoderCell)
- Quality review (ReviewerCell)
- Meta-reasoning and reflection (ReflectionCell)

Each cell uses 2+ agents in a produce-critique-revise loop
until consensus is reached.
