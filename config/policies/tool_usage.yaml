# L9 Governance - Tool Usage Policies
# ====================================
# Policies controlling which tools agents can execute.
# 
# Tools are categorized by risk level:
# - Low: Information retrieval (search, read)
# - Medium: External communication (http requests)
# - High: System modification (file write, shell exec, database write)
