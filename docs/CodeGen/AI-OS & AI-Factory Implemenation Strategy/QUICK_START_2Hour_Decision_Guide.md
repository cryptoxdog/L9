## 5 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Layer 1 Must Hit <100ms Latency
```
If ✓ achieved:      Continue to Layer 2 (Week 3-4)
If ✗ not achieved:  Debug and retry (max 2 more weeks)
If still ✗:         Discuss scope reduction
```

### 2. Team Must Stay Focused
```
No scope creep
No side projects
Dedicated 5.5 FTE
Clear priorities
```

### 3. Infrastructure Must Be Ready
```
GPU cluster operational
Ray framework deployed
Development environments online
CI/CD pipelines configured
```

### 4. Leadership Support Must Be Constant
```
Monthly executive updates
Quick decisions on blockers
Budget available on demand
Team protected from disruptions
```

### 5. Documentation Must Stay Current
```
Code comments (every function)
Architecture diagrams
Decision logs
Progress tracking
```

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Layer 1 Taking Too Long?
→ Reduce to MVP (working model > optimal latency)
→ Adjust Layer 2 timeline
→ Bring in contractor if needed

### Budget Shortfall?
→ Phase the work (6-month delay vs 24-month)
→ Use cloud GPUs instead of owning
→ Prioritize layers 1, 2, 5 (highest ROI)

### Team Turnover?
→ Have backups trained
→ Cross-train on all layers
→ Document everything
→ Hire replacements ASAP

### Leadership Loses Faith?
→ Show early wins (Layer 1 latency)
→ Share ROI analysis regularly
→ Celebrate milestones
→ Demo working system monthly

### Infrastructure Fails?
→ Move to cloud immediately
→ Don't let it block development
→ Can work on Layer 4 (governance) offline
→ Provision backup systems
