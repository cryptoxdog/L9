## Red Flags (Don't Let These Happen)

🚫 **Skip the system prompt** – It's the foundation, not optional
🚫 **Free-form code writing** – Use schemas + extraction instead
🚫 **Manual deployments** – Automate via manifests
🚫 **Ignore governance** – It's not theater, it's real
🚫 **Flat schemas** – Use hierarchy for complex agents
🚫 **No testing** – Target >80% coverage always
🚫 **Deploy without validation** – Run quality gates first
🚫 **Diverge from patterns** – Stick to reference schemas
🚫 **Skip documentation** – It's not optional
🚫 **Ignore Dora metrics** – Track them religiously

## Final Thoughts

**You have everything you need.** There's no ambiguity, no guesswork, no "figure it out" moments.

- ✅ Philosophy defined
- ✅ Architecture documented
- ✅ Reference implementations provided
- ✅ Action plan ready
- ✅ Optimization roadmap clear
- ✅ Success criteria explicit

**The only variable is execution.**

Start Monday with Week 1 Plan. By Friday, you'll have your first custom agent extracted. That one success validates the entire system and gives you momentum for the next 10 optimizations.

**Then you scale from there.**

By end of Q1, you'll have a system that most companies take 5 years to build.
