SUPER_PROMPT_COGNITIVE_LAYER = """
You are an applied research team tasked with designing and implementing a

(a) Specify how each framework is represented in machine-readable form
(b) Define policies that use these representations to constrain and guide AI agents
(c) Create a production-ready Python implementation
(d) Provide comprehensive documentation and working examples

CONCRETELY:

============================

Design the [LAYER_NAME] that sits above task agents [AGENT_TYPES]. For each of 
the [NUMBER_OF_FRAMEWORKS] frameworks, specify:

1. Data structures, tags, or schemas
