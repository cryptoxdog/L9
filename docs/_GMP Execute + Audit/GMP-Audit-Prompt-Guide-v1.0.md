# GMP Audit v1.0 — Example Implementation & Usage Guide

**Document:** GMP Audit v1.0 Implementation Guide  
**Date:** 2025-12-24  
**Purpose:** Show how to invoke and execute the Audit GMP after completing a prior GMP

---

## Overview

The **GMP Audit v1.0** is a comprehensive verification protocol that audits whether a previously executed GMP was completed correctly. It mirrors the structure of GMPv1.0 itself, ensuring deterministic, machine-verifiable results.

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Input** | Original locked TODO plan + edited files |
| **Output** | Single audit report (markdown) |
| **Phases** | 9 phases (0 = setup, 1–8 = verification, 9 = finalization) |
| **Evidence** | Line-by-line code verification with quotes |
| **Confidence** | 100%, 95%, 75%, or 0% (based on file visibility & verification success) |
| **Fail-Fast** | Stops immediately if critical issue found |
| **Format** | 100% compatible with GMPv1.0 structure |

---

## When to Use Audit GMP

✅ **Use after:** Any GMP execution (Stage 1, 2, 3, etc.)  
✅ **Use before:** Stage 2 approval gate  
✅ **Use to:** Verify scope adherence, detect errors, confirm completeness  
✅ **Use for:** Automated quality gates in CI/CD workflows

❌ **Don't use for:** Code review beyond scope, architecture recommendations, refactoring suggestions

---

## Invocation Flow

### Step 1: Obtain Original Locked TODO Plan

From the original GMP execution document, copy:

```markdown
## TODO PLAN (LOCKED)

- [0.1] File: `/l9/path/to/file1.py` Lines: 44–52 Action: Replace
      Change: Replace X with Y
      Gate: None
      Imports: NONE

- [0.2] File: `/l9/path/to/file2.py` Lines: 100–110 Action: Insert
      Change: Add error checking
      Gate: None
      Imports: logger
```

### Step 2: Provide Edited Files

Attach or reference the files that were modified:
- Full files (100% content visibility) preferred
- Snippets acceptable (with confidence penalty)

### Step 3: Invoke Audit GMP

**Request format:**

```
Auditor, please run the GMP Audit v1.0 on the following execution:

ORIGINAL LOCKED TODO PLAN:
[Paste the locked TODO plan from Step 1]

FILES PROVIDED:
[List files or attach them]

REPORT PATH:
/l9/reports/audit_report_<task_name>.md

Begin Phase 0.
```

### Step 4: Receive Audit Report

The auditor produces a single markdown file at the specified path containing:
- Sections 1–11 (all phases documented)
- Evidence for every TODO
- Final verdict (PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL)
- Confidence level and limitations

---

## Example Audit Report (Complete)

Here's what an audit report looks like:

```markdown
# AUDIT REPORT — Stage 1 Critical Issues Fix

## AUDIT SCOPE (LOCKED TODO PLAN REFERENCE)

- [0.1] File: `/l9/gmp_approval.py` Lines: 15–18 Action: Replace
      Change: Replace `x for x in tasks` → `[x for x in tasks if x.status == 'pending']`
      Gate: None
      Imports: NONE

- [0.2] File: `/l9/mcp_client.py` Lines: 142–160 Action: Replace
      Change: Replace fake success return with explicit error
      Gate: None
      Imports: None (logger already imported)

[... more TODOs ...]

## AUDIT INDEX HASH

Original TODO plan hash: `abc123def456...` (deterministic checksum)

## FILES PROVIDED + CONTENT VISIBILITY

| File | Provided | Visibility | Size | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| gmp_approval.py | ✅ | 100% | 3,883 B | Full file |
| mcp_client.py | ✅ | 100% | 7,953 B | Full file |
| gmp_worker.py | ✅ | 100% | 9,323 B | Full file |
| long_plan_graph.py | ✅ | 100% | 19,045 B | Full file |
| memory_helpers.py | ✅ | 100% | 8,235 B | Full file |

Visibility: 100% (all files full content)
Missing files: None
Confidence impact: ✅ No penalty

## TODO IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION (Item-by-Item)

### [0.1] gmp_approval.py — List Comprehension Fix

**Specification:**
- File: `/l9/gmp_approval.py`
- Lines: 15–18
- Action: Replace
- Target: `list_pending_gmp_tasks()` function
- Change: Fix syntax error in list comprehension (missing brackets)

**Verification:**

- [x] **Location correct?** Lines 15–18 in `list_pending_gmp_tasks()` ✅
      ```python
      # Before (error): x for x in tasks if x.status == 'pending'
      # After (fixed): [x for x in tasks if x.status == 'pending']
      ```

- [x] **Action verb fulfilled?** Replace syntax error with correct list comprehension ✅

- [x] **Target structure unchanged?** Rest of function intact ✅
      - Function signature: unchanged
      - Return type: unchanged
      - Error handling: unchanged

- [x] **New behavior matches spec?** Now correctly filters pending tasks ✅
      - Old: SyntaxError when executed
      - New: Returns list of pending tasks

- [x] **Imports added if required?** No new imports needed ✅

- [x] **No scope creep?** Only this line range modified ✅

- [x] **Syntactically valid?** Yes, valid Python list comprehension ✅

- [x] **Logically sound?** Yes, filters by status == 'pending' ✅

- [x] **Backward compatible?** Yes, same function signature and return type ✅

- [x] **Logger/error handling?** Not required by TODO ✅

**Verification Result: ✅ COMPLETE AND CORRECT**

---

### [0.2] mcp_client.py — Error Stub Replacement

**Specification:**
- File: `/l9/mcp_client.py`
- Lines: 142–160
- Action: Replace
- Target: `MCPClient.call_tool()` method
- Change: Replace fake success return with explicit error

**Verification:**

- [x] **Location correct?** Lines 142–160 in `call_tool()` method ✅
      ```python
      # Old (before):
      return {
          "success": True,
          "result": {"message": "MCP tool call (stub)"},
          "error": None,
      }
      
      # New (after):
      return {
          "success": False,
          "error": "MCP protocol not yet implemented — available in Stage 2",
          "result": None,
      }
      ```

- [x] **Action verb fulfilled?** Replaced entire return statement ✅

- [x] **Target structure unchanged?** Rest of function intact ✅
      - Function signature: unchanged
      - Parameters: unchanged
      - Try-except block: preserved

- [x] **New behavior matches spec?** Now explicitly fails instead of faking success ✅
      - Old: Returned {success: True} → silent failure
      - New: Returns {success: False} → explicit error

- [x] **Imports added if required?** No new imports (logger already present) ✅

- [x] **No scope creep?** Only this return statement modified ✅

- [x] **Syntactically valid?** Yes, valid Python dict literal ✅

- [x] **Logically sound?** Yes, error message clear and actionable ✅

- [x] **Backward compatible?** Yes, return type matches existing contract ✅

- [x] **Logger/error handling?** Logger call present before return ✅
      ```python
      logger.warning(f"MCP tool call requested but not implemented...")
      ```

**Verification Result: ✅ COMPLETE AND CORRECT**

|------|---|---|---|---|
| gmp_approval.py | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ |
| mcp_client.py | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ |
| gmp_worker.py | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ |
| long_plan_graph.py | 2 | 2 | 0 | ✅ |
| memory_helpers.py | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ |

**Scope Creep Finding: ✅ NONE DETECTED**

All changes mapped to original TODO plan. No unauthorized edits.

## AUDIT CONFIDENCE LEVEL + LIMITATIONS

### Confidence Calculation

```
Confidence = (Files_Provided / Files_Needed)
           × (Content_Visible / Content_Total)
           × (TODOs_Verifiable / TODOs_Total)
           × Quality_Score

           = (5 / 5)
           × (100% / 100%)
           × (6 / 6)
           × (100%)
           = 100% ✅
```

### Confidence Breakdown

| Component | Value | Impact |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Files provided | 5/5 (100%) | ✅ No penalty |
| Content visible | 100% | ✅ No penalty |
| TODOs verifiable | 6/6 (100%) | ✅ No penalty |
| Syntax errors | 0 | ✅ No penalty |
| Logic errors | 0 | ✅ No penalty |
| Integration issues | 0 | ✅ No penalty |

**Final Confidence: 100% ✅**

### Limitations

None. All files provided in full, all TODOs verifiable, zero errors detected.

## Implementation Notes

This example audit report shows:

1. **Full TODO verification** — Each TODO gets a detailed checklist with evidence
2. **Line-by-line evidence** — Code snippets quoted directly from files
3. **Zero assumption** — Only facts verifiable from provided files
4. **Deterministic results** — Same files + same audit GMP = same verdict
5. **Single output** — All results in one report at required path
6. **Clear verdict** — PASS (all TODOs correct) vs. FAIL (issues found)

---

## Troubleshooting Audit GMP Execution

### Issue: "File not provided"
**Solution:** Attach the file or update report confidence to 75% with note

### Issue: "Syntax error detected in TODO implementation"
**Solution:** Audit FAILS at Phase 5. Report must identify line number and error

### Issue: "Unauthorized change detected"
**Solution:** Audit flags as scope creep. Lists exactly what was changed outside plan

### Issue: "TODO partially implemented"
**Solution:** Mark as `[~]` with confidence note (95% instead of 100%)

### Issue: "Can't verify because file snippet provided"
**Solution:** Mark confidence as 95% and note which TODO confidence is reduced

---

## Key Takeaway

The **GMP Audit v1.0** enables automated verification that:
- ✅ Original TODO plan was followed exactly
- ✅ No scope creep or freelancing occurred
- ✅ All implementations are syntactically correct
- ✅ Integration is sound
- ✅ Ready for Stage 2 approval

**Result: 100% confidence in execution quality** (when audit passes)
