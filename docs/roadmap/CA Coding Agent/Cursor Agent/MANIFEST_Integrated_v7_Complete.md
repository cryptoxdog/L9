## RISK MATRIX & MITIGATION

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Cursor integration bugs | Low | High | Full testing; rollback plan |
| AGENT_RULES too strict | Medium | Medium | Learning loop adjusts; manual override at REPLAN |
| Team turnover | Low | High | Cross-training; documentation |
| Infrastructure failure | Low | High | Fallback to cloud; automated failover |
| Acceptance criteria ambiguity | Medium | Medium | Escalation triggers; manual clarification |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | SAST scanning; manual code review; escalation |
