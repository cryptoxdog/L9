## Key Innovation: Multi-Pass Research Strategy

Rather than conducting one large search and hoping to capture everything, this framework uses **iterative passes**:

- **Pass 1**: Broad landscape survey identifies major themes
- **Pass 2**: Vertical investigation of identified themes with granular detail
- **Pass 3**: Detailed comparison of specific implementations
- **Pass 4**: Analysis identifies research gaps and future directions
- **Pass 5**: Gap analysis generates testable hypotheses

Each pass builds on previous pass findings, enabling **adaptive research** that adjusts focus as patterns emerge.

**Result**: More comprehensive, better-organized, and more actionable than traditional linear searches.
