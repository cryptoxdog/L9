## Planned 📋

### Stage 7: L-CTO Agent Integration (HIGHEST PRIORITY) 🚨
- [ ] **Phase 1: Memory Migration**
  - [x] Archive deprecated Supabase clients (`l-cto/l_memory/memory_client.py`, `kg_client.py`)
  - [ ] Remove Supabase dependencies from `l-cto/memory/` routers
  - [ ] Migrate `MemoryRouterV4` to use `MemorySubstrateService` instead of Supabase
  - [ ] Replace custom L1/MAC/META table routing with `PacketEnvelope` + `agent_id` filtering
  - [ ] Delete deprecated `l-cto/l_memory/` directory (already archived)

- [ ] **Phase 2: Agent Architecture Refactor**
  - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Refactor `LMission` + `LEngine` into separate, granular layers
  - [ ] Extract reasoning engine as shared component (not L-CTO-specific)
  - [ ] Extract governance checks as shared component (not L-CTO-specific)
  - [ ] Make L-CTO use `agents/l_cto.py` (BaseAgent) + shared reasoning/governance layers
  - [ ] Ensure all agents can plug into shared reasoning engines (architectural requirement)

- [ ] **Phase 3: Multi-Agent Memory Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Verify `PacketEnvelope.metadata.agent` supports multi-agent filtering
  - [ ] Add agent_id constants: `l-cto`, `l9`, `cursor`, `emma`
  - [ ] Ensure memory queries filter by `agent_id` for isolation
  - [ ] Test cross-agent memory access patterns (shared vs private)

- [ ] **Phase 4: L-CTO Integration Points**
  - [ ] Wire `agents/l_cto.py` into `AgentExecutorService` (task routing)
  - [ ] Add FastAPI route `/api/agents/l-cto/directive` (direct HTTP access)
  - [ ] Register L-CTO in `AgentRegistry` with `agent_id="l-cto"`
  - [ ] Test both integration points (executor + HTTP route)

- [ ] **Phase 5: Slack Integration for L-CTO**
  - [ ] Wire L-CTO into Slack webhook routing (similar to existing Slack → L9 flow)
  - [ ] Ensure L-CTO can receive DMs and channel messages
  - [ ] Add placeholder for Emma Slack integration (future)

- [ ] **Phase 6: Naming Standardization**
  - [ ] Run rename script: `python scripts/rename_l_to_l_cto.py` (dry-run completed)
  - [ ] Rename all code references: "l" → "l-cto" (agent_id, class names, imports)
  - [ ] Keep "L" as display name in user-facing messages only
  - [ ] Update all YAML configs, kernel files, docs to use "l-cto" in code
  - [ ] Consider renaming `l-cto/` directory to `l_cto/` for Python import compatibility

**Dependencies:**
- Stage 7 blocks: None (can start immediately)
- Stage 7 enables: Multi-agent orchestration, Emma agent integration, advanced agent coordination

**Notes:**
- L-CTO integration is **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Architecture principle: Granular, pluggable agents with shared reasoning engines (NOT monolithic LMission/LEngine)
- Memory principle: Shared infrastructure with `agent_id` filtering (NOT per-agent databases)
- Emma agent: Spec outside repo, add placeholders where prudent
- Supabase: Fully deprecated - use `MemorySubstrateService` + `PacketEnvelope` only

### Stage 4: LLM-Powered Artifact Generation
- [ ] `long_plan_graph.py` → LLM code generation in planning nodes
- [ ] `long_plan_graph.py` → LLM documentation generation
- [ ] Artifact storage and versioning
- [ ] Plan → Executable workflow conversion

### Stage 5: Research Swarm
- [ ] `orchestrators/research_swarm/orchestrator.py` → Implement orchestration logic (currently stub)
- [ ] `orchestrators/research_swarm/convergence.py` → Implement convergence/specialized logic
- [ ] Wire ResearchSwarmOrchestrator into API (see Stage 2.6 Phase 3)

### Stage 6: Persistence & Reliability
- [ ] World Model snapshots persisted to storage
- [ ] World Model restore from snapshot
- [ ] Checkpoint-based recovery
- [ ] Event sourcing for state reconstruction

### Stage 2.8: MCP Memory Scope Enforcement ❌ CANCELLED

**Status:** CANCELLED (2026-01-08) — MCP Memory server was deprecated in favor of REST API.

**Reason:** MCP Memory SSE endpoints were never implemented. Memory access now works via:
- `cursor_memory_client.py` → REST API (`/api/v1/memory/*`)
- Direct `MemorySubstrateService` calls for L-CTO

**Archived Files:**
- `_archived/archived_mcp_memory/` — Historical MCP server code
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` — Removed `l9-memory` entry

**Scope enforcement (if needed in future):** Implement in REST API memory router, not MCP.

## Future (Deferred) 🔮

### Self-Evolution Capabilities
> ⚠️ **DEFERRED** - Requires careful security review and governance framework.

The following capabilities are intentionally deferred until proper safety mechanisms are in place:

- **Code self-modification**: Evolution engine reading/writing its own source code
- **Autonomous refactoring**: L9 proposing and applying changes to itself
- **Capability expansion**: L9 adding new tools/executors without human approval

**Prerequisites before implementation:**
1. Comprehensive governance framework
2. Human-in-the-loop approval workflow
3. Rollback mechanisms with full audit trail
4. Sandboxed testing environment for self-modifications
5. Rate limiting on self-modification operations
6. External monitoring and kill switch

**Related stubs (not to be implemented without approval):**
- `orchestrators/evolution/apply_engine.py` → `_read_file()`, `_write_file()`
- Any code that would allow L9 to modify files in its own repository

## Development Environment 🛠️

### Python Environment Fix (LibreSSL → OpenSSL)

**Problem:** macOS system Python (`/usr/bin/python3`) uses LibreSSL 2.8.3, which triggers `NotOpenSSLWarning` from urllib3 v2.

**Current Status:** Warning suppressed in `conftest.py` (temporary workaround).

- [ ] **Recreate venv with Homebrew Python**
  - [ ] Delete existing venv: `rm -rf venv`
  - [ ] Create with Homebrew Python: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -m venv venv`
  - [ ] Reinstall dependencies: `source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - [ ] Verify OpenSSL: `python -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"` → should show OpenSSL 3.x

**Why:** Homebrew Python is compiled with OpenSSL 3.6.0, eliminating the SSL compatibility warning and enabling full TLS 1.3 support.
