Priority,Gap,Impact if Not Fixed,Effort (weeks),Frontier Lab Solution
P0,Virtual Context Management,Cannot handle long conversations; context window limits all agents,8,MemGPT virtual context; Mem0 compression
P0,Automatic Memory Consolidation,Memory grows unbounded; no semantic deduplication or compression,6,Mem0 3-stage pipeline (extract/consolidate/retrieve)
P0,Agent Self-Editing Memory,Agents can't learn from experience; every session starts fresh,10,MemGPT self-directed editing via function calling
P0,Tool Audit Trail,No auditability for tool calls; impossible to debug tool workflows,4,AWS Bedrock AgentCore auto-logging; Google Vertex Agent Engine
P0,Evaluation Framework,No way to measure/improve agent quality; blind to regressions,6,Vertex AI Evaluation; AWS Bedrock Evaluation
P1,Subagent Spawning,Cannot decompose complex tasks; limited parallelism,8,Claude SDK subagents; Google ADK parallel agents
P1,Agent-to-Agent Protocol,Agents can't collaborate; rigid coordinator bottleneck,6,Google A2A Protocol; Anthropic MCP
P1,Code Execution Sandbox,Cannot execute dynamic code; limited to predefined tools,10,Claude Code sandbox; Vertex AI Code Execution
P1,Session Management,Every interaction is stateless; poor UX for returning users,4,AWS AgentCore Session API; Google Vertex Memory Bank
P1,Distributed Tracing,Cannot debug production issues; no visibility into agent thinking,4,OpenTelemetry + Cloud Trace/CloudWatch
P2,Prompt Versioning,Cannot reproduce issues; prompt drift undetectable,3,Vertex AI prompt versioning; AWS prompt registry
P2,Cost Tracking,Cannot budget/optimize tool usage; runaway API costs,4,AgentCore per-call cost API; Google billing integration
P2,Example Store,No closed-loop improvement; agents don't get better over time,8,Vertex AI Example Store; Claude improvement loop
